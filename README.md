# Rusty Advent of Code

This repo holds my solutions to the advent of code problems implemented in Rust.
I am using this mostly as a way to familiarize myself with the Rust language
as I have plans to work on future projects in Rust and would like to be more
comfortable with it before that time.

### Usage

Unless otherwise specified, the syntax for all of the solutions is:

```
cargo run {path to input}
```

This command should be run from the directory of whichever solution you would
like to run (i.e. day1 for Day 1's solution).

### Organization

This repo contains solutions to the AoC problems from multiple years.
The solutions are organized by year and then by day. As of 2017, each solution
folder will also have a README that states the lessons that I learned by
producing that day's solution. These lessons will be specifically geared
towards what I learned about Rust as that is one of the main reasons behind
this project.
