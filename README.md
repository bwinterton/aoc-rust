# Rusty Advent of Code

This repo holds my solutions to the advent of code problems implemented in Rust.
I am using this mostly as a way to familiarize myself with the Rust language
as I have plans to work on future projects in Rust and would like to be more
comfortable with it before that time.

### Usage

Unless otherwise specified, the syntax for all of the solutions is:

```
cargo run {path to input}
```

This command should be run from the directory of whichever solution you would
like to run (i.e. day1 for Day 1's solution).
